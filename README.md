# zeioth-meta
A futile attempt to have a resume of all my projects on a single page.

## Content I should write here?

* AUR packages
* Pipy packages
* Npm packages
* Startups y subproyectos de estas. Experiencia y roles.

## TODO:

* Copy here the same of all your repositories. 
* Delete what is not relevant. 
* Add descriptions and photos.

## Startup projects

Projects listed here were developed for startups i've been cofounder of. 

* Jinn.es: The interactive traveling guide. National alternative to foursquare. Winner startup of the 1º edition of Think Big Telefonica Spain. Mentorized by the Banesto foundation (Yuzz progam).
* GameMetrics.com: Analytics for game developers. Website that through the use of web crawling, statistics, and our own internal API, provided crucial market data to videogame developers. Incubated in ImpactHub Bucharest (Romania) and Polo Digital (Málaga).


## Remarkable projects


* [zeioth-qmk](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-qmk): I coded this C driver for a wired wireless keyboard I built. I use it for coding when I'm not at home with my pocket computer. [More info](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-keyboard-firmware).
* [zeioth-zmk](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-zmk): I coded this C driver for a bluetooth wireless keyboard I built. I use it for coding when I'm not at home with my pocket computer. Because this version is wireless, it uses a different technology, so this is a new driver I wrote from scratch. [More info](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-keyboard-firmware).
* [wofi-emoji](https://github.com/Zeioth/wofi-emoji): Emoji selector for Linux based on WOfi. The original author abandoned the project, so I continued it and fixed some bugs.![screenshot_2023-02-08_21-48-40_829722436](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3357792/217647818-1f710289-6032-4d3e-be83-4020e86fcf66.png)
