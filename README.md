# zeioth-meta
A futile attempt to have a resume of all my projects on a single page. 

## About third party data protection
Please, understand that out of respect to my contractors, I can't disclose detailed information about projects I've woked on for third party companies. In most cases this include screenshots, and/or implementation details. So in this section I will focus on my contributions to the open source community.

## Content I should write here?

* AUR packages
* Pipy packages
* Npm packages
* Startups y subproyectos de estas. Experiencia y roles.

## TODO:

* Copy here the same of all your repositories. 
* Delete what is not relevant. 
* Add descriptions and photos.

## Startup projects

Projects listed here were developed for startups i've been cofounder of. 

* Jinn.es: The interactive traveling guide. National alternative to foursquare. Winner startup of the 1º edition of Think Big Telefonica Spain. Mentorized by the Banesto foundation (Yuzz progam).
* GameMetrics.com: Analytics for game developers. Website that through the use of web crawling, statistics, and our own internal API, provided crucial market data to videogame developers. Incubated in ImpactHub Bucharest (Romania) and Polo Digital (Málaga).


## Remarkable projects


* [zeioth-qmk](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-qmk): I coded this C driver for a wired wireless keyboard I built. I use it for coding when I'm not at home with my pocket computer. [More info](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-keyboard-firmware).
* [zeioth-zmk](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-zmk): I coded this C driver for a bluetooth wireless keyboard I built. I use it for coding when I'm not at home with my pocket computer. Because this version is wireless, it uses a different technology, so this is a new driver I wrote from scratch. [More info](https://github.com/Zeioth/zeioth-keyboard-firmware).
* [wofi-emoji](https://github.com/Zeioth/wofi-emoji): Emoji selector for Linux based on WOfi. The original author abandoned the project, so I continued it and fixed some bugs.![screenshot_2023-02-08_21-48-40_829722436](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3357792/217647818-1f710289-6032-4d3e-be83-4020e86fcf66.png)

## Personal/fun projects
* [Brros](https://github.com/Zeioth/BrrrOS): My personal non distributable linux dirtribution, for personal usage. It's an installer that you run in a clean arch linux environment. It will install hundreds of packages and custom configurations in an automated way. It allows me to reinstall my system in a matter of minutes.

* Automated cloud backups: Bash script that encrypt and upload all my (safe) personal files to the cloud through a programmed task. It allow me to recover from any potential problem in my computer in a matter of minutes. I haven't made this one public, because it is 100% custom.
